# UniformConf Next.js Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Configure environment variables

The project is already configured to use a sample Uniform project.
Check out the [.env file](./.env) for instructions on how to use your own project instead.

### Install packages

```shell
npm i
# or
yarn
```

### Run the development server

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open <http://localhost:4120> with your browser to see the result.

### Push predefined content to your empty Uniform Project
```shell
npm run push
# or
yarn push
```
